# Minishell üêö

As beautiful as a shell

![Quick Demo][quick-demo]

## About

The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. Yes, your little bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

## A brief introduction üíº

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with
a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to english.
With Minishell, you‚Äôll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didn‚Äôt exist.

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
The only requirements are:
- GNU make (v3.81)
- Apple clang version 13.0.0

Those versions are the ones used during development.

### Building the program

1. Download/Clone this repo

	`git clone git@github.com:MikelTolino/minishell.git`

2. `cd` into the root directory and run `make`

        cd minishell
        make

### Running the program

After building the source, run `./minishell` from the project root.
